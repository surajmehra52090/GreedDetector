[This](https://theandroidmaster.github.io/GreedDetector/) is a website/quiz that supposedly measures how greedy you are. It was made for an english project, but why not, I might as well make it open source so everyone can roast me for my horrible organization and code style.

Because I'm too lazy to actually set up any form of remote database, this website stores all statistics through local storage. For this reason, all the statistics will be blank until you have taken the quiz at least once.
